          In the heart of Kauaiâ€™s west side, where recreational programs for
          children are few, a new initiative was born: Kamali`i Fishing
          Challenge. Launched by the Port Allen Fishing Club and spearheaded by
          Margie Goodman, the event seeks to provide an enriching experience for
          both youth and adults alike. Norman Kali, a driving force behind the
          project, envisioned a community-centered, local style celebration
          uniting hundreds of children and their families. With strong support
          from island sponsors, this effort seeks to demonstrate that on Kaua`i,
          our strength is in our collective spirit.
